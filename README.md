LSST CCD Acceptance Testing Files
=================================

This package provides Python code to assist in producing and
validating FITS files containing results of CCD acceptance testing.
Every LSST CCD test station must supply results in the form of a
compliant FITS file.

See doc/schema.org for details of the compliant file format.
