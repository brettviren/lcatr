** Dark Frames

 - Script :: =dark=

 - Method :: take n dark frames at m expose times.

 - Main analysis/DAQ problems ::

   - Cosmic rays
   - Light leaks

 - Results ::	

   - Average dark-current (ADU/sec) per amp
   - Average dark-current (ADU/sec) per amp in first k rows near each amplifier
   - Noise (ADU)
   - Number and List of noisy locations
   - Number and List of column defects
   - Dark-current fits file, perhaps including masked regions.

** Linearity Function or Photon Transfer Curve

 - Script :: =ptc=

 - Method :: take 2 equal exposure files from 0sec to n sec.  Increasing exposure time set of data that
provides information about the gain (electrons to adu)


 - Main analysis DAQ problems ::

   - Need optimization of expose times to get to full well (how much charge a CCD pixel can hold without leaking.
   - White light, or ~830nm to get lots of statistics
   - Gain depends upon exposure
   - Uniform illumination

 - Results ::

   - Noise (two methods) ADU per amplifier
   - Gain (two methods) e/ADU per amplifier
   - Dark (cold) pixels number and location
   - Full well
   - Illumination correction parameters (quadratic fit?)
   - Edge response maps
   - PRNU (photo response non uniformity) per amp (entire imaging area, after illumination correction)
   - PRNU per amp (after illumination, edge correction)
   - Deviation from linear response (fractional deviation of ADU/sec) from ~100e to ~90% of full well
   - CTE (charge transfer efficiency, = 1- average chage that gets lost as the buckets of charge gets read out) at three ADU (or gain) (ADU is like ADC, "analogue to digital units"?) values based upon overscan
   - Flat field fits file, perhaps including masks

** Quantum Efficiency

 - Script :: =QE=
 - Method :: take exposures from 300nm to 1100nm +dark exposure
 - Main analysis/DAQ problems ::
   -	Need calibration of PD
   -	Need optimization of wavelength selection, band width, and exposure times for adequate statistics 
Results:
   -	QE at each wavelength (after correction for gains, illumination)
   -	PNRU at each wavelength (after illum, edge response corrections)
   -	Summary image files, showing structure patterns

** Fe55

 - Script :: =FE55=
 - Method :: take bias and Fe55 exposures
 - Main analysis/DAQ problems ::
 - Results ::
   -	Gain of each amp
   -	CTE
   -	Noise in image region

** Jig

 - Script :: =jig=
 - Method :: take pocket-puming script data	
 - Main analysis/DAQ problems::
   -	Decide optimum
 - Results ::
   -	List of traps, location and strength

** Cooling

 - Script :: =cool=
 - Method :: take successive data dark, 500nm, 1000nm as device cools to operating temp, and then warms up after tests	
 - Main analysis/DAQ problems:
   -	Decide optimum
 - Results ::
   -	List of traps, location and strength
