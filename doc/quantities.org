** Dark Frames

 - Script :: =dark=

 - Method :: take n dark frames at m expose times.

 - Main analysis/DAQ problems ::

   - Cosmic rays
   - Light leaks

 - Results ::	

   - Average dark-current (ADU/sec) per amp
   - Average dark-current (ADU/sec) per amp in first k rows near each amplifier
   - Noise (ADU)
   - Number and List of noisy locations
   - Number and List of column defects
   - Dark-current fits file, perhaps including masked regions.

** Linearity Function or Photon Transfer Curve

 - Script :: =ptc=

 - Method :: take 2 equal exposure files from 0sec to n sec.  Increasing exposure time set of data that
provides information about the gain (electrons to adu)


 - Main analysis DAQ problems ::

   - Need optimization of expose times to get to full well (how much charge a CCD pixel can hold without leaking.
   - White light, or ~830nm to get lots of statistics
   - Gain depends upon exposure
   - Uniform illumination

 - Results ::

   - Noise :: (two methods) ADU per amplifier (two 'E' columns)
   - Gain :: (two methods) e/ADU per amplifier (two 'E' columns)
   - Dark :: (cold) pixels number and location (special table)
   - Full well ::
     - =LinRangeMin= 'E' 'Minimum ADU in which CCD stays within LinearSpecs'
     - =LinRangeMax= 'E' 'Maximum ADU in which CCD stays within LinearSpecs'
     - =LinearResponse= 'E' 'Maximum deviation from linear response in Full LinRangeâ€™

   - Illumination correction parameters (quadratic fit?) :: 6 parameters, quadratic in X and Y
     - Not saved yet

   - Edge response maps :: not yet well defined
     - Not saved yet
     - expect systematic differences in 4/16, might save CCD average

   - PRNU :: photo response non uniformity per amp (entire imaging area, after illumination correction)
     - =PRNUTotal= and =PRNUCorrected= x =White= and =Mid=
     - May also want two per-CCD numbers (total and corrected)

   - Deviation from linear response :: 3 numbers 
     - =LinRangeMin=, =LinRangeMax=, =LinRangeResponse=
     - fractional deviation of ADU/sec from ~100e to ~90% of full well

   - CTE :: =CTEoverscanA_N= for A in (X,Y) and N in (1,2,3)
     - Better to set A to the actual threshold
     - Store as cards unless threshold will not stay fixed over life of testing
     - charge transfer efficiency
     - is: (1- average chage that gets lost as the buckets of charge gets read out) at three ADU (or gain) (ADU is like ADC, "analogue to digital units"?) values based upon overscan

   - Flat field fits file, perhaps including masks
     - Not to be stored in DB

** Quantum Efficiency

 - Script :: =QE=
 - Method :: take exposures from 300nm to 1100nm +dark exposure
 - Main analysis/DAQ problems ::
   -	Need calibration of PD
   -	Need optimization of wavelength selection, band width, and exposure times for adequate statistics 
Results:
   -	QE at each wavelength (after correction for gains, illumination)
   -	PNRU at each wavelength (after illum, edge response corrections)
   -	Summary image files, showing structure patterns

** Fe55

 - Script :: =FE55=
 - Method :: take bias and Fe55 exposures
 - Main analysis/DAQ problems ::
 - Results ::
   -	Gain of each amp
   -	CTE
   -	Noise in image region

** Jig

 - Script :: =jig=
 - Method :: take pocket-puming script data	
 - Main analysis/DAQ problems::
   -	Decide optimum
 - Results ::
   -	List of traps, location and strength

** Cooling

 - Script :: =cool=
 - Method :: take successive data dark, 500nm, 1000nm as device cools to operating temp, and then warms up after tests	
 - Main analysis/DAQ problems:
   -	Decide optimum
 - Results ::
   -	List of traps, location and strength
